I'm a student graduating from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) majoring in mechanical engineering, with a keen interest in **biomedical devices** and **human-machine interaction** as a new learner. Currently, I'm also into the machine learning to see the possibility with combination of biomechanical application. Sincerely looking for a MPhil/PhD position right now.
